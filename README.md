# Speech Emotion Recognition: A Comparative Study Using CNN and SVM with MFCCs

## Overview

This repository accompanies the technical paper titled "Speech Emotion Recognition: A Comparative Study Using CNN and SVM with MFCCs." The paper explores the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in conjunction with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for speech emotion recognition. The study delves into the methodologies employed in both approaches, providing detailed insights into the techniques utilized for accurate emotion recognition from speech signals.

## Abstract

Speech emotion recognition is a critical aspect of human-computer interaction, finding applications in various domains such as virtual assistants, customer service, and mental health diagnostics. This paper presents a comparative study of two prevalent machine learning techniques, CNN and SVM, coupled with MFCCs, for speech emotion recognition. The CNN model utilizes deep learning to discern intricate patterns within spectrograms, whereas the SVM model employs a robust classification algorithm for emotion recognition. The paper discusses the methodologies, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and comparative analysis of both approaches, shedding light on their strengths and limitations.
